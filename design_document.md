**Technical Design Document: Group Savings Plan Project**

**1. Introduction:**
The Group Savings Plan project aims to provide a platform for users to create and manage group savings plans with their friends. Users can create accounts, create group savings plans, invite friends to join the plans, and manage the plan membership.

**2. Architecture:**
The project follows a client-server architecture, with the client being a web application and the server providing RESTful APIs to handle user requests. The server-side application is built using Typescript with Express.js framework for routing and middleware management. The database is managed using MySQL, and TypeORM is used as the ORM to interact with the database.

**3. Components:**
- **Server-side Application:** The server-side application handles incoming requests from the client-side application and processes them accordingly. It includes the following components:
  - **Controllers:** Controllers handle the business logic for different types of requests. For example, UserController handles user-related requests, and SavingsPlanController handles savings plan-related requests.
  - **Services:** Services encapsulate the core business logic and interact with the database through repositories. For example, UserService handles user-related business logic, and SavingsPlanService handles savings plan-related business logic.
  - **Repositories:** Repositories are responsible for interacting with the database. They use TypeORM to perform CRUD operations on database entities.
  - **Middleware:** Middleware functions are used for tasks such as authentication, error handling, and request validation.

- **Database:** The MySQL database stores user information, savings plans, and plan membership data. It consists of tables for users, savings plans, and a join table to represent the many-to-many relationship between users and savings plans.

**4. APIs:**
The server-side application exposes a set of RESTful APIs to the client-side application for performing various actions. Some of the key APIs include:

- **User APIs:** These APIs handle user registration and authentication.
- **Savings Plan APIs:** These APIs handle creating, joining, and declining savings plans, as well as sending invitations to friends.

**5. Security:**
- **Authentication:** Users are required to register and log in to access the platform. Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely authenticate and authorize users.
- **Authorization:** Certain actions, such as creating a savings plan or sending invitations, are restricted to authenticated users who own the plan.

**7. Future Enhancements:**
Some potential future enhancements for the project include:

- Implementing additional features such as chat functionality for group members.
- Providing the user interface to improve usability and user experience.
- Implementing notifications to keep users informed about important updates related to their savings plans.

**8. Conclusion:**
The Group Savings Plan project provides a convenient platform for users to collaborate with their friends and achieve their savings goals together. The project aims to empower users to take control of their finances and build a better future.
